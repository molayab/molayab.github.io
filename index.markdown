  ## Teo's Thoughts
  I write about technology, software development, software architecture and personal 
  notes (mostly in Spanish). Mateo hopes to help others with his thoughts and 
  open-source projects. He loves the good practices and well-defined code and thinks 
  that it is the correct way to make a solid development. Welcome!
